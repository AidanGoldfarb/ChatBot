The storage part is organized as data structures; the processing part is captured as algorithms. Together, these form the heart of every computer application (in science, government, business, and the arts), on every kind of information (pictures, numbers, sound, and text). We will study the most fundamental data structures and algorithms as a means of using computers more effectively, and as preparation for more advanced study in CS and related fields.</description><primaryCSL/><CoLocated/><restrictions>None</restrictions><instructors>Alan Beadle</instructors><sectionenrolled>1</sectionenrolled><sectioncap>50</sectioncap><classinfo/><updated>02/14/2021</updated><schedules><schedule><day>MWF</day><location>Online Room 15 (ASE)</location><start_time>900</start_time><end_time>1150</end_time><start_date>07/06/2021</start_date><end_date>08/13/2021</end_date></schedule></schedules></course><course><CourseSectionListing>COURSE_SECTION-3-102850</CourseSectionListing><cn>CSC 170-1</cn><term>Spring 2021</term><yr_term>Spring 2021</yr_term><school>Arts, Sciences, and Engineering</school><dept>Computer Science</dept><title>Intro to Web Development</title><status>Open</status><credits>  4.0</credits><offered>Fall Spring Summer </offered><description>An introduction to the World Wide Web and related technologies.

In this course, we will follow the growth of the Web from its toddler years, to early childhood, to its turbulent pre-teen and teenage years, and finally as it begins to mature as a young adult. Along this journey, you will learn influential Web technologies such as HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, the LAMP stack, XML, JSON, Ajax, WebSockets, and modern MVC frameworks. Even though you will be doing a lot of programming in this course, its purpose is not to teach you to become an expert in any particular language or framework. Web technologies change at a blistering pace, so specifics quickly get outdated. However, once you take this course and understand the fundamentals, you will be able to easily pick up new technologies on the fly. *No audits will be allowed for this course.

This course will help students to build a frame of reference of HCI approaches and apply them in conducting design practices for real-world problems. This course contains a combination of lectures, seminars and group projects. The lectures will cover origins of HCI and interaction design, user-centered design methods, usability evaluation and user experience. The seminars will be a combination of guest lecturers and student-led discussions to introduce special topics in HCI, which may include Augmented and Virtual Reality, Tangible User Interface, Human-Robot Interaction, learning technologies, and assistive technologies. The group project will take place throughout the course and provide an opportunity for students to apply and reflect on HCI methods and user-centered design processes through contextual inquiry, prototyping, evaluation, iteration and presentation.

Students will study the theoretical methods for design and evaluation, including requirements gathering, survey design, ethnography, rapid prototyping, and evaluation techniques. The theoretical knowledge will be supplemented with hands-on group projects including a final project.

Program analysis and transformation is the automation of programming itself---how much a program can understand and improve other programs. Because of the diversity and complexity of computer hardware, programmers increasingly depend on automation in compilers and other tools to deliver efficient and reliable software. This course combines fundamental principles and (hands-on) practical applications. Specific topics include data flow and dependence theories; static and dynamic program transformation including parallelization; memory and cache management; type checking and program verification; and performance analysis and modeling. The knowledge and practice will help students to become experts in software performance and correctness. Students taking the graduate level will have additional course requirements and a more difficult project.

Seminar</title><status>Open</status><credits>  2.0</credits><offered>Fall Spring  </offered><description>An introduction to the technical, social, economic, and political aspects of graduate education in computer science at Rochester. Class meetings consist primarily of group discussions and presentations that focus on a broad range of topics, and are intended to improve the critical analysis, technical writing, presentation, and problem-solving skills of students. Both class discussions and written assignments are drawn from material presented in other first-year graduate courses offered within the department. The course also offers a forum for individual department faculty members to discuss their research interests and recent results.

It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education &amp;amp; professional training.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2021, the following three modules will be offered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;AR/VR in the silicon (Prof. Yuhao Zhu). This module will first take a look at how AR and VR are evolving and some applications and use cases. Then, we will provide a review of some of the key technology challenges in silicon, a.k.a., processor chips, that need to be overcome before widespread deployment of AR and VR and the breakthroughs in silicon that are required to enable this future. We will then discuss some recent advances proposed to meet the silicon performance/power targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment (Prof. Mujdat Cetin). Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems aim to establish direct interaction channels between the brain and external devices. In this module, we will explore recent and ongoing efforts to couple noninvasive EEG-based BCIs with AR/VR systems. The module will cover topics including (1) brain activity as a control signal in AR/VR systems, (2) cognitive state monitoring and affective BCIs in virtual environments, (3) analyzing neural activity to guide AR/VR system design.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module will involve a series of seminars and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</description><primaryCSL/><CoLocated>BCSC 571-1, BME 413-1, CSC 414-1, CVSC 535-1, ECE 411-1 (P), NSCI 416-1, OPT 438-1</CoLocated><restrictions>Instructor permission required for Undergraduates - AS&amp;E</restrictions><instructors>Mujdat Cetin</instructors><sectionenrolled>0</sectionenrolled><sectioncap>0</sectioncap><classinfo/><updated>12/23/2020</updated><schedules><schedule><day>MW</day><location>Online Room 17 (ASE)</location><start_time>1025</start_time><end_time>1140</end_time><start_date>02/01/2021</start_date><end_date>05/14/2021</end_date></schedule></schedules></course><course><CourseSectionListing>COURSE_SECTION-3-102980</CourseSectionListing><cn>CSC 440-1</cn><term>Spring 2021</term><yr_term>Spring 2021</yr_term><school>Arts, Sciences, and Engineering</school><dept>Computer Science</dept><title>Data Mining</title><status>Open</status><credits>  4.0</credits><offered>Fall Spring Summer </offered><description>Fundamental concepts and techniques of data mining, including data attributes, data visualization, data pre-processing, mining frequent patterns, association and correlation, classification methods, and cluster analysis.

Program analysis and transformation is the automation of programming itself---how much a program can understand and improve other programs. Because of the diversity and complexity of computer hardware, programmers increasingly depend on automation in compilers and other tools to deliver efficient and reliable software. This course combines fundamental principles and (hands-on) practical applications. Specific topics include data flow and dependence theories; static and dynamic program transformation including parallelization; memory and cache management; type checking and program verification; and performance analysis and modeling. The knowledge and practice will help students to become experts in software performance and correctness. Students taking the graduate level will have additional course requirements and a more difficult project.</description><primaryCSL/><CoLocated>CSC 255-1 (P), CSC 455-1, ECE 455-1, TCS 455-1</CoLocated><restrictions>None</restrictions><instructors>Sreepathi Pai</instructors><sectionenrolled>13</sectionenrolled><sectioncap>36</sectioncap><classinfo/><updated>11/10/2020</updated><schedules><schedule><day>MW</day><location>Bausch &amp; Lomb Room 106</location><start_time>1025</start_time><end_time>1140</end_time><start_date>02/01/2021</start_date><end_date>05/14/2021</end_date></schedule></schedules></course><course><CourseSectionListing>CSC456_20211_58077</CourseSectionListing><cn>CSC 456-1</cn><term>Fall 2020</term><yr_term>Fall 2020</yr_term><school>Arts, Sciences, and Engineering</school><dept>Computer Science</dept><title>Operating Systems</title><status>Open</status><credits>  4.0</credits><offered>Fall Spring Summer </offered><description>Principles of operating system design, explored within the practical context of traditional, embedded, distributed, and real-time operating systems.

In real-time and using low power, visual computing systems must generate visual data for&lt;/i&gt;human&lt;i&gt; to consume, immersively, or interpret visual data to provide personalized services, intelligently. I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;n this class, we will first study fundamental building blocks for visual computing such as real-time computer vision, computer graphics, deep learning, image sensing, and optics. We will then explore application domains that build on top of these fundamental building blocks such as AR/VR, computational photography/imaging, robotics, and self-driving cars.The course will necessarily span many important layers of a computer system, including application development, programming language and framework, compiler, OS, and hardware architecture.This class will combine instructor-led lectures, student-led in-class presentations, paper reading/critiquing, and the fun &amp;#34;wild and crazy&amp;#34; paper writing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><primaryCSL/><CoLocated>CSC 292-1 (P), CSC 572-1</CoLocated><restrictions>None</restrictions><instructors>Yuhao Zhu</instructors><sectionenrolled>10</sectionenrolled><sectioncap>48</sectioncap><classinfo/><updated>03/06/2020</updated><schedules><schedule><day>WF</day><location>Online Room 10 (ASE)</location><start_time>1150</start_time><end_time>1305</end_time><start_date>08/26/2020</start_date><end_date>12/18/2020</end_date></schedule></schedules></course><course><CourseSectionListing>COURSE_SECTION-3-98714</CourseSectionListing><cn>CSC 575-1</cn><term>Fall 2020</term><yr_term>Fall 2020</yr_term><school>Arts, Sciences, and Engineering</school><dept>Computer Science</dept><title>Special Topics in Human-Centered AI</title><status>Open</status><credits>  4.0</credits><offered>Fall Spring Summer </offered><description>&lt;b&gt;Living with pandemics: can AI help mitigate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, no one knew of SARS-CoV2. Now the virus has disrupted modern society on an unimaginable scale. Like WWW2 or the 9/11 attacks, the pandemic is having a permanent imprint on the world’s psyche. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this class, we will try to understand the network topologies of how this phenomenon spread, its current impact in our society and possible mitigation strategies through the lens of Artificial Intelligence. We will study new considerations in telemedicine (people trying to care for elderly relatives without exposing them to the virus), online learning (stresses on parents thrust into home-schooling their kids, the transformation of academic institutions creating online classes), location tracking apps that prioritize users privacy, mental health (how does our design ensure social distances when needed while promoting social connectedness),  and consequences of the global inequality in healthcare. Students will work on a semester-long project with new CoV2 datasets answering novel research questions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prerequisite: CSC 242, CSC 246&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a seminar course on varying topics related to Human Computer Interaction. This course may not be offered every year.</description><primaryCSL/><CoLocated/><restrictions>None</restrictions><instructors>Ehsan Hoque</instructors><sectionenrolled>10</sectionenrolled><sectioncap>15</sectioncap><classinfo/><updated>04/08/2020</updated><schedules><schedule><day>R</day><location/><start_time>1650</start_time><end_time>1930</end_time><start_date>08/26/2020</start_date><end_date>12/18/2020</end_date></schedule></schedules></course><course><CourseSectionListing>COURSE_SECTION-3-97748</CourseSectionListing><cn>CSC 576-1</cn><term>Fall 2020</term><yr_term>Fall 2020</yr_term><school>Arts, Sciences, and Engineering</school><dept>Computer Science</dept><title>Adv Topics in Data Management</title><status>Open</status><credits>  4.0</credits><offered>Fall Spring Summer </offered><description>Data is everywhere: Web data, dark data, open data, and more . A grand challenge of data management systems is to make the fast-growing (heterogeneous) data actionable for data science, advanced analytics, and query answering. To that end, this course studies classic and emerging topics in data management including data-related challenges of data science, data discovery and integration, Web data management, and knowledge base instruction. The course also briefly explores the research related to the issues of fairness in data management. The course will be a mix of lectures, student presentations, round table discussions, a semester-long research project, and paper writing. Ultimately, this course aims to engage students in creative thinking and problem solving, and familiarize students with how data management research is conducted. Prerequisites: CSC 461 (or equivalent course) or permission of the instructor.</description><primaryCSL/><CoLocated/><restrictions>None</restrictions><instructors>Fatemeh Nargesian</instructors><sectionenrolled>6</sectionenrolled><sectioncap>25</sectioncap><classinfo/><updated>03/06/2020</updated><schedules><schedule><day>TR</day><location>Meliora Room 203</location><start_time>1230</start_time><end_time>1345</end_time><start_date>08/26/2020</start_date><end_date>12/18/2020</end_date></schedule></schedules></course><course><CourseSectionListing>COURSE_SECTION-3-108732</CourseSectionListing><cn>CSC 577-1</cn><term>Spring 2021</term><yr_term>Spring 2021</yr_term><school>Arts, Sciences, and Engineering</school><dept>Computer Science</dept><title>Advanced Topics in Computer Vision</title><status>Open</status><credits>  4.0</credits><offered>Fall Spring Summer </offered><description>This is a seminar course with varying topics in the area of artificial Intelligence.
