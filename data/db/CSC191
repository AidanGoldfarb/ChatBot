CSC191 has the course title "Machines and Consciousness". CSC191 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Lenhart Schubert. CSC191 is offered every Fall. Can machines show self-awareness? Could robots and other machines have subjective sensory and emotional experiences? Could they have a moral sense? These questions are becoming increasingly relevant in our age of increasingly intelligent machines. We will explore these issues through readings from the AI literature as well as from philosophy and cognitive science. Homework will include written answers to questions, essays, 2 Lisp exercises and -- for 291 students only -- a team programming project intended to demonstrate the possibility of some degree of self-awareness in a computer. The course is optionally available for writing credit.
