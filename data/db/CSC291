CSC291 has the course title "Machines and Consciousness". CSC291 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Lenhart Schubert. CSC291 is offered every "Summer Spring Fall ". Can machines show self-awareness? Could robots and other machines have subjective sensory and emotional experiences? Could they have a moral sense? These questions are becoming increasingly relevant in our age of increasingly intelligent machines. We will explore these issues through readings from the AI literature as well as from philosophy and cognitive science. Homework will include written answers to questions, essays, 2 Lisp exercises and -- for 291 students only -- a team programming project intended to demonstrate the possibility of some degree of self-awareness in a computer. The course is optionally available for writing credit.  Prerequisites: CSC173 and one or more of 240, 242, 280 , or 282.
