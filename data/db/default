The undergraduate degree programs are a BS in computer science, a BA in computer science, and a minor in computer science. They are designed to be flexible enough to satisfy the needs of all students interested in computer science. Their goals are twofold:
    To give students a solid and rigorous background in computer science principles, including the requisite mathematical foundations,
    To expose students to the problems and solution techniques used in the various areas of the discipline.

Faculty Advisors are full-time Computer Science faculty members whose primary appointment is within the CS Department. Faculty Advisors are your go-to for questions about research within the Department, course content, graduate school in CS, etc. All CS students must meet with their faculty advisor during the Advising Period and to have their add/drop forms signed.

The Undergraduate Program Coordinators can help you to officially declare the CS major/minor, obtain course approvals (transfer credit/study abroad), get add/drop forms stamped, create course plans, register for Independent Study, etc.

If you are undeclared, please use the Hajim Intended Major Change Form to switch into/out of Computer Science.
To update your official CS course plan, discuss the changes with your CS program coordinator.
If you will need to take additional semester on campus to satisfy degree requirements, be sure to meet with a financial aid counselor to see how this affects your aid package.

If you are double majoring with math, there could be overlaps in addition to the standard three, so please check with your advisor or with the math department.
Please note that due to the overlap policy, double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science is not permitted.
