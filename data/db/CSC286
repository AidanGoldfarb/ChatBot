CSC286 has the course title "Computational Complexity". CSC286 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Lane Hemaspaandra. CSC286 is offered every "Summer Spring Fall ". The difference between computable and uncomputable problems andbetween feasible and infeasible problems. Regarding the latter, what properties of a problem make it computationally simple? What properties of a problem may preclude its having efficient algorithms? How computationally hard are problems? Complete sets and low information content; P=NP?; unambiguous computation and one-way functions; reductions relating the complexity of problems; complexity classes and hierarchies. Prerequisite: CSC280
