Computers are universal tools to store and process information. The storage part is organized as data structures; the processing part is captured as algorithms. Together, these form the heart of every computer application (in science, government, business, and the arts), on every kind of information (pictures, numbers, sound, and text). We will study the most fundamental data structures and algorithms as a means of using computers more effectively, and as preparation for more advanced study in CS and related fields.
