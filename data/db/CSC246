CSC246 has the course title "Machine Learning".
CSC246 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Adam Purtee.
CSC246 is offered every Spring.
Mathematical foundations of classification, regression, and decisionmaking. Perceptron algorithm, logistic regression, and support vector machines. Numerical parameter optimization, including gradientdescent and quasi-Newton methods. Expectation Maximization. Hidden Markov models and reinforcement learning. Principal Components Analysis. Learning theory including VC-dimension and PAC learning guarantees. Prerequisites: MATH164 and MATH165, CSC242 (and therefore CSC172)Â  strongly recommended.
