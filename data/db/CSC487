CSC487 has the course title "Sampling Algorithms".
CSC487 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Daniel Stefankovic.
CSC487 is offered every Fall.
<div>The course will focus on algorithmic sampling from probability distributions using Markov chains, perfect sampling methods (coupling from the past, Lovasz Local Lemma), determinantal techinques (spanning trees, matchings in planar graphs), and using correlation decay. For MCMC we will study methods to bound convergence speed (coupling, canonical paths, conductance, log-concavity) and show how they apply to classical problems (colorings, permanent, volume, matroids). Background material on probability theory will be covered.</div>
