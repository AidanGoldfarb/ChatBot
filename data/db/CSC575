CSC575 has the course title "Special Topics in Human-Centered AI". CSC575 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Ehsan Hoque. CSC575 is offered every Fall. Living with pandemics: can AI help mitigate?A few months ago, no one knew of SARS-CoV2. Now the virus has disrupted modern society on an unimaginable scale. Like WWW2 or the 9/11 attacks, the pandemic is having a permanent imprint on the world’s psyche. In this class, we will try to understand the network topologies of how this phenomenon spread, its current impact in our society and possible mitigation strategies through the lens of Artificial Intelligence. We will study new considerations in telemedicine (people trying to care for elderly relatives without exposing them to the virus), online learning (stresses on parents thrust into home-schooling their kids, the transformation of academic institutions creating online classes), location tracking apps that prioritize users privacy, mental health (how does our design ensure social distances when needed while promoting social connectedness),  and consequences of the global inequality in healthcare. Students will work on a semester-long project with new CoV2 datasets answering novel research questions.  Prerequisite: CSC242, CSC246This is a seminar course on varying topics related to Human Computer Interaction. This course may not be offered every year.
