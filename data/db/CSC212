CSC212 has the course title "Human Computer Interaction".
CSC212 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Ehsan Hoque.
CSC212 is offered every Spring.
The course will explore the design, implementation, and evaluation of user-driven prototypes to be used by real users. Students will study the theoretical methods for design and evaluation, including requirements gathering, survey design, ethnography, rapid prototyping, and evaluation techniques. The theoretical knowledge will be supplemented with hands-on group projects including a final project. The final project will involve interactions with real-users along with a working prototype which hopefully could be deployed and used by people beyond the scope of this course.Prerequisites: CSC172 and CSC242.
