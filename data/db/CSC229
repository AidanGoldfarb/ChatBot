CSC229 has the course title "Computer Models of Perception and Cognition".
CSC229 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Robert Jacobs.
CSC229 is offered every Fall.
How can computer models help us understand how people perceive and reason about their environments? This course addresses this question, with emphasis placed on how people use probabilistic reasoning in order to represent and manage ambiguity and uncertainty for the purpose of making intelligent decisions. The course is relevant to students with interests in computational studies of human perception and cognition, and to students with interests in artificial intelligence. Homework assignments will require students to write computer programs using the Python programming language.Prerequisites: MATH161, MATH162, and CSC161 (or equivalent proficiency in Python programming) required. MATH164, MATH165, and/or STAT213 are helpful but not required.
