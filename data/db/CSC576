Data is everywhere: Web data, dark data, open data, and more . A grand challenge of data management systems is to make the fast-growing (heterogeneous) data actionable for data science, advanced analytics, and query answering. To that end, this course studies classic and emerging topics in data management including data-related challenges of data science, data discovery and integration, Web data management, and knowledge base instruction. The course also briefly explores the research related to the issues of fairness in data management. The course will be a mix of lectures, student presentations, round table discussions, a semester-long research project, and paper writing. Ultimately, this course aims to engage students in creative thinking and problem solving, and familiarize students with how data management research is conducted. Prerequisites: CSC 461 (or equivalent course) or permission of the instructor.
