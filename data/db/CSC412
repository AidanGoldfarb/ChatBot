CSC412 has the course title "Human Computer Interaction". CSC412 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Ehsan Hoque. CSC412 is offered every Fall. This course will explore the design, implementation, and evaluation of user interfaces. Students will study the theoretical methods for interface design and evaluation, including requirements gathering, usability heuristics, user interface inspections, usability studies, information visualization, and prototyping. Case studies of interface successes and failures will augment theory with practical experiences. Students will apply this methodology to assignments in the design, implementation, and evaluation cycle. Students taking this course at the graduate level will have additional readings and assignments.
