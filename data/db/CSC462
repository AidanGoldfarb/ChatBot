CSC462 has the course title "Computational Introduction to Statistics". CSC462 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Joseph Ciminelli. CSC462 is offered every Fall. This course will cover foundational concepts in descriptive analyses, probability, and statistical inference. Topics to be covered include data exploration through descriptive statistics (with a heavy emphasis on using R for such analyses), elementary probability, diagnostic testing, combinatorics, random variables,  elementary distribution theory, statistical inference, and statistical modeling. The inference portion of the course will focus on building and applying hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for population means, proportions, variances, and correlations. Non-parametric alternatives will also be introduced. The modeling portion of the course will include ANOVA, and simple and multiple regression and their respective computational methods. Students will be introduced to the R statistical computing environment. PREREQUISITES: MTH150 or MTH150A; AND MTH142 or MTH161 or MTH171WAITLIST: If registration is full, submit your info to our Fall 2020 waitlist at: https://forms.gle/yc8u4rs5raBoeW2V7
