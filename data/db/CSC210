CSC210 has the course title "Web Programming". CSC210 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Robert Kostin. CSC210 is offered every "Summer Spring Fall ". The World Wide Web was born around 1990, so it is not much older than most of you. In this course, we will follow the growth of the Web from its toddler years, to early childhood, to its turbulent pre-teen and teenage years, and finally as it begins to mature as a young adult. Along this journey, you will learn influential Web technologies such as HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, the LAMP stack, XML, JSON, Ajax, WebSockets, and modern MVC frameworks. Even though you will be doing a lot of programming in this course, its purpose is not to teach you to become an expert in any particular language or framework. Web technologies change at a blistering pace, so specifics quickly get outdated. However, once you take this course and understand the fundamentals, you will be able to easily pick up new technologies on the fly. *No audits will be allowed for this course. Prerequisites: CSC172
