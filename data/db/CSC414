CSC414 has the course title "Selected Topics in Augmented and Virtual Reality".
CSC414 is a 4.0 credit course taught by Mujdat Cetin.
CSC414 is offered every Spring.
This is the second course offered as part of the PhD training program on augmented and virtual reality. It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education &amp; professional training.<span> </span></p><p>In Spring 2021, the following three modules will be offered:</p><p>1)<span> </span>AR/VR in the silicon (Prof. Yuhao Zhu). This module will first take a look at how AR and VR are evolving and some applications and use cases. Then, we will provide a review of some of the key technology challenges in silicon, a.k.a., processor chips, that need to be overcome before widespread deployment of AR and VR and the breakthroughs in silicon that are required to enable this future. We will then discuss some recent advances proposed to meet the silicon performance/power targets.</p><p>2)<span> </span>Brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment (Prof. Mujdat Cetin). Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems aim to establish direct interaction channels between the brain and external devices. In this module, we will explore recent and ongoing efforts to couple noninvasive EEG-based BCIs with AR/VR systems. The module will cover topics including (1) brain activity as a control signal in AR/VR systems, (2) cognitive state monitoring and affective BCIs in virtual environments, (3) analyzing neural activity to guide AR/VR system design.<span> </span></p><p>3)<span> </span>Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module will involve a series of seminars and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry.</p><p>prerequisites:</p><p>ECE 410 or OPT 410 or BME 410 or NSCI 415 or CSC 413 or CVSC 534</p><p>
